# {UniHack 6}
UniHack is an international hackathon for high school and university students.
It is hosted by Liga AC in Timișoara, from November 7 to 10, 2024.
The project aims to encourage young people to actively engage with their community by developing technical solutions to real-world problems it faces.
In an inclusive and resourceful environment, under the guidance of mentors and NGOs in the field,
participants have 48 hours to develop solutions that improve aspects such as:
social inclusion, education, environmental sustainability, health, and the digitalization of local administrative processes.
## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 
What makes our hackathon unique is the focus on civic issues. Our aim is that by separating the event into tracks each team can pick the area that interest them most and will allow them to solve problems that they faced in their comunities.
To help participants with coming up with ideeas and get insight from leaders in the local IT field we also organized the Conference at Iulius Congress Hall which followed a panel structure with 5 speakers.
After the conference followed the Networking Night. The purpose of the Networking Night is to offer our participants the context to exchange ideeas and socialize before the hackathon and it is a great opportunity for participants to find other teammates or form teams.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>
Other than the GitHub Copilot workshop held by MLH we organized the following workshops: GitHub basics, How-To Teamwork and How To Pitch Your Project.
Besides workshops we also had fun avtivities over the course of the weekend, some organized with the help of MLH as well. Some of those include: paper airplane competition, lego build contest and Just Dance competition. 
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> 
All projects had to be published in a github repo that we had access to. Many participants also used GitHub Copilot to help with their projects.

The participants found the pizza to be a great change of pace from the food we managed to get from our university cafeteria.

- We also want to see how hackers used GitHub at the event <br>
Every team was required to set up a github repo so we could monitor their progress. Also thanks to MLH for their GitHub copilot training our participants were able to leverage that in order to develop their projects better and faster.
- What made them special? _Include the link to their website, Devpost or video._
