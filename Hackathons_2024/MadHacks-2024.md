# MadHacks 2024
> We had another great year of MadHacks, the largest hackathon in Wisconsin! <br>
 - **November 9th-10th** 
 - **University of Wisconsin-Madison / MadHacks**
 - **USA, WI, Madison**  

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> 
- We had a number of workshops hosted by our organizers, and some hosted by our sponsors! We had a welcome workshop that helped hackers with getting started/planning their
projects, a workshop on using GitHub for devoloping as a team, and a website workshop put on by Girls Who Code! Then we had a React workshop,
and finished off the night with a late-night estimathon. Our sponsors also ran a few workshops with prizes to help our hackers showcase their skills.
- Our organizers hosted a workshop around developing and sharing code using GitHub. We had our participants use GitHub to host their code for their project submissions, and there was a GitHub Copilot workshop too.
- *We’d love to see pictures if you have them!* <br>

## Event Metrics 
> Feel free to include any other metrics that you think may be important or applicable.
- We had over 1000 applicants, but we only had room for 300 participants due to our building's size, so we could only admit 300 people. In total, we had a bit over 250 hackers check in on the day of the event! We had thousands of dollars in prizes as well, and we had 10 teams win prizes.
